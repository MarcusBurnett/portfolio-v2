My mind was made up after reading a number of developers' blogs, which pointed out that, given the speed at which technology advances, the topics selected at the start of a 4 year course would likely be outdated by the end of it.",

It was fantastic to see the company develop, growing from 250k users when I joined, to over 1 million members when I left, and as part of a rather small team I have been able to contribute and grow as a developer. Being a part of such as small team meant I was given a lot of responsibility, and is where I started working in a design/developer hybrid role, both designing and building products for O2, EE and more",
